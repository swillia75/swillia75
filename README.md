- 👋 Hi, I’m @swillia75
- 👀 I’m interested in using SQL, python,  Tableau, and Javascript to contribute to the success of a
company or to help improve people's way of life
- 🌱 I’m currently looking to enter the data science field with a chemistry biology background
where I generated data and used excel to report the data. I also used the SQL based LIMS database to
store and query data generated in our labs.
